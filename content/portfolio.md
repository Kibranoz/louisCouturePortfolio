## Debatemps : Debate timer
DÃ©batemps is a debate timer application that supports many debate formats, such as British and Canadian Parliamentary. It uses an object oriented approach in order to have a modular design, which makes it easy to add new debate formats. It is currently available on Google Play but could theoretically run both on iOS and Android.

## Timenote 

Timenote is a timestamp editor application. It was developped in order to get timestamps of specific moments during online classes that were recorded, enabling easy access to a moment where the teacher was talking about something.  It is available as a Progressive Web App (PWA) or as a standalone application on Linux. It supports both a light and dark mode.

## Polcompass

PolCompass is an application like the electoral compass but with more general questions about politics. The user can see their position changing on the political compass as they answer questions. It is actively being worked on, and I plan on adding the possibility for people and organizations to create their own political compass and use it in the app.
