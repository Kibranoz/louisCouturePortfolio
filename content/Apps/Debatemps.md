## Debatemps : Debate timer
Débatemps is a debate timer application that supports many debate formats, such as British and Canadian Parliamentary. It uses an object oriented approach in order to have a modular design, which makes it easy to add new debate formats. It is currently available on Google Play but could theoretically run both on iOS and Android.
