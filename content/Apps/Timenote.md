Timenote is a timestamp editor application. It was developped in order to get timestamps of specific moments during online classes that were recorded, enabling easy access to a moment where the teacher was talking about something.  It is available as a Progressive Web App (PWA) or as a standalone application on Linux. It supports both a light and dark mode.
