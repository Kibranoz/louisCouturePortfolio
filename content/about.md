I am a software developer who graduated from Université Laval **looking for a new job**.
I have expertise in web and mobile development, particularly responsive applications. I am also capable of doing backend work in several languages. I learn easily on my own and I am autonomous.
People say that I have good teamwork skills and a strong analytical mindset.
I am meticulous and quality is something important to me.

## My interests
